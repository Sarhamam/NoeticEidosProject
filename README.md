**Latent Geometry for Large Language Models**

The Noetic Eidos Project is an open research initiative exploring the differential geometric structure of large language models (LLMs). By modeling latent space through the lens of information geometry, Riemannian metrics, and heat kernel analysis, this project aims to provide a principled mathematical framework for interpretability, structure, and control in modern AI systems.

## 🔬 Summary
This project introduces a pullback metric approach to analyze the geometry of latent representations in LLMs. Using the Fisher–Rao information metric on decoder distributions, a Riemannian geometry is induced on input space via the encoder. Attention mechanisms are interpreted as approximations to heat diffusion across this manifold.

### Key Concepts
- Pullback of the Fisher–Rao metric
- Curvature and Laplace–Beltrami operator
- Attention as heat kernel
- Local geometric structure of semantic complexity
- Geometric interpretability of LLMs

### Current Work
- (High Priority) - Implement the proof of concept to verify the validity of the framework.
- Formal hypothesis: semantic regions exhibit non-zero curvature; syntax is geometrically flat
- Geometric analysis of learned spaces via local invariants
- Connections to quantum systems and wavefunction diffusion via heat kernel
- Fisher-Rao metric PB pushforward possiblity for trained models (Approximating Reimmanian Submersions?)
- Chain of agents for analysis of topics : Define → Dissect → Reconstruct → Generalize as a problem solving pipeline

## Our Philosophy
We believe that any system capable of shaping language, thought, or decision-making at scale—especially superintelligent models—must operate under transparent, inspectable structures. Interpretability is not a feature; it is an ethical foundation.

We do not insist on geometry as the only solution, but we recognize its natural alignment: geometric methods allow structure to be analyzed even without access to model weights or training data. This makes them a powerful candidate for building public, auditable reasoning systems.

The Noetic Eidos Project stands for structural transparency, and the right to understand the logic that governs our words.

## 🤝 Contributions
This is a solo open-research project initiated by Saar Hamam at July 9th 2025.
All mathematical and theoretical development, including the Submersion Hypothesis, Latent Geometry Framework, and Quantum Analogy, were developed within the first week.
All theoretical frameworks, ideas, and writing are the intellectual work of the author. AI tools (such as ChatGPT) were used as assistants in shaping, drafting, and iterating on formalization.

Feel free to explore, cite, and extend the work under the terms of the license, preferably in this project.
