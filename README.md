**Latent Geometry for Large Language Models**

The Noetic Eidos Project is an open research initiative exploring the differential geometric structure of large language models (LLMs). By modeling latent space through the lens of information geometry, Riemannian metrics, and heat kernel analysis, this project aims to provide a principled mathematical framework for interpretability, structure, and control in modern AI systems.

## 🔬 Summary
This project introduces a pullback metric approach to analyze the geometry of latent representations in LLMs. Using the Fisher–Rao information metric on decoder distributions, a Riemannian geometry is induced on input space via the encoder. Attention mechanisms are interpreted as approximations to heat diffusion across this manifold.

### Key Concepts
- Pullback of the Fisher–Rao metric
- Curvature and Laplace–Beltrami operator
- Attention as heat kernel
- Local geometric structure of semantic complexity
- Geometric interpretability of LLMs

### Current Work
- Formal hypothesis: semantic regions exhibit non-zero curvature; syntax is geometrically flat
- Geometric analysis of learned spaces via local invariants
- Connections to quantum systems and wavefunction diffusion via heat kernel
